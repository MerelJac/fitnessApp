# Workout Tracker

 ## Description 
 This application allows the user to log workouts easily and efficently with exercise customization and set tracking. This application is designed for athletes who want to keep track of their workouts in real time but are tired of the tediousness of searching for the correct exercise and entering in set information. 

 Upon clicking create new workout, the athelte can enter in the root exercise like "Chest Press" and add attributes like "incline" or "barbell" after the fact to limit phone time during a workout. If the user enters "Incline Chest Press" to the text box, the application will parse the attribute from the main lift and sort accordingly on the page. The athlete can log weights and reps and store the set information in local storage. 

 When the user clicks save, they are presented with a workout summary that is saved to local storage. 

 If the user is unsure what workout to do, they can select to randomly generate a workout from the main page. The user is then presented with 8 exercises depening on their choice of a full body, upper body, or lower body workout. Since the user did not customize these exercises, they are presented with a gif example of the exercise and information about targeted muscle groups and necessary equiptment. 

 ## Future Develpments 
 In upcoming versions, the user will be able to edit past workout information and store more than one workout at a time. The implementaion of remote databases will advance the scope of this application greatly. Ideally, the application will store information for each exercise to help predict percent of one rep maxes to enable a stronger athlete.
