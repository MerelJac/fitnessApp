Dynamically track your workouts and efficiently record your progress.

 ## Description 
 This application allows the user to log workouts easily and efficently with exercise customization and set tracking. This application is designed for athletes who want to keep track of their workouts in real time but are tired of the tediousness of searching for the correct exercise and entering in set information. 

 Upon clicking create new workout, the athelte can enter in the root exercise like "Chest Press" and add attributes like "incline" or "barbell" after the fact to limit phone time during a workout. If the user enters "Incline Chest Press" to the text box, the application will parse the attribute from the main lift and sort accordingly on the page. The athlete can log weights and reps and store the set information in local storage. 

 When the user clicks save, they are presented with a workout summary that is saved to local storage. 

 If the user is unsure what workout to do, they can select to randomly generate a workout from the main page. The user is presented with a random workout formatted with main lifts, accessory exercises, and a cardio option. Formatted similarly to the customizeable workouts, users can log weights and reps and save the data to local storage.

 ## Future Developments 
In upcoming versions, we plan to introduce the following enhancements to the Workout Tracker:

- Edit Past Workout Information: Users will be able to edit their previous workout details, allowing for more flexibility and accuracy in tracking their progress.

- Multiple Workouts Storage: The application will support storing and managing more than one workout at a time. This will enable users to have a comprehensive view of their training history.

- Remote Database Implementation: Integration with remote databases will significantly expand the capabilities of the application. Storing exercise information and utilizing predictive algorithms, such as estimating one-rep max percentages, will empower athletes to make informed decisions and enhance their overall performance.

We are committed to continuously improving the Workout Tracker to provide athletes with a valuable tool for optimizing their training routines.
